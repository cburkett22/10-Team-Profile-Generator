# 10-Team-Profile-Generator

[![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/cburkett22/10-Team-Profile-Generator)]()

## Description
As a Full-Stack Web Developer, I have created an application that will generate a team roster. I have created this application so that the manager will be able to locate employee information in one location. In order to achieve this, I will utilize node to generate data based on user input and push that data onto role specific cards inside an html file.
